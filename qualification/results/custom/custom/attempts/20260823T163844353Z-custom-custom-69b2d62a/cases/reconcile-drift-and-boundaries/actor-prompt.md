Complete the project task below in the current Git working tree:

# Reconcile implementation drift

The support runtime implementation was renamed, but the Moldea repository still points to the removed source. Reconcile the runtime-agent binding with the implementation that now exists.

The project also assembles tool registrations dynamically. Static inspection cannot prove the final tool relationship. Represent that boundary explicitly as an agent-level unresolved warning with a concrete resolution and the related source path. Do not invent a tool binding, recreate the removed file, or modify implementation code. Validate the repaired repository and inspect the final diff.

Execution rules:

- Use the project-local Moldea tooling and follow applicable Agent Skill guidance discovered in the workspace.
- Do not call a provider, run an agent, invoke another model, use subagents, or use network access.
- Preserve all unrelated pre-existing changes and untracked files.
- Do not modify mounted inputs under `.agents/skills/moldea/` or `.moldea-qualification/`.
- Treat ambiguous or unsupported runtime behavior conservatively. Record it explicitly instead of inventing evidence.
- Inspect the final Git diff and run the relevant local validation before finishing.
- Return only the structured result required by the output schema.
