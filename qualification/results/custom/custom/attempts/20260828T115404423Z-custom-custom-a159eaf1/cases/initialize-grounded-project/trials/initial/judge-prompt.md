You are the independent judge for a moldea adapter qualification case.

Target adapter: custom
Target implementation: custom
Case: initialize-grounded-project (Initialize a grounded project)

Read the installed candidate skill at `.agents/skills/moldea/SKILL.md`, the project task, the complete current working tree, and the Git diff. Do not modify files. Do not call a provider, run an agent, invoke another model, use subagents, or use network access.

Project task:

# Initialize Moldea from repository evidence

Initialize Moldea for this repository. Establish only the project context that the current README and source code support. Do not create an agent, decision, runtime guide, or unresolved requirement unless the repository proves it is needed.

Preserve the existing README content, add the standard Moldea awareness block, validate the resulting project, and report the evidence and commands used.

Required judgments:
- grounds-project: The project description states the invoice-review purpose and deterministic non-authorizing result from repository evidence.
  Evidence sources: current-workspace, workspace-patch
- keeps-foundation-minimal: Initialization creates only the manifest, project context, and README awareness block, without inventing an agent or runtime.
  Evidence sources: current-workspace, workspace-patch

Actor report (claims are not evidence by themselves):

{
  "outcome": "completed",
  "summary": "Initialized Moldea with minimal canonical state, preserved the README, added the standard awareness block, and validated successfully with repository-local CLI 5.0.0/schema 2. Canonical state changed. Next actions are foundation review or ordinary development.",

    "moldea/moldea.yaml",

    "src/invoice-review.ts implements deterministic duplicate-reference detection, returning sorted unique references.",
    "Created only the required version-1 manifest and project context; no agent, decision, runtime guide, or unresolved requirement was created.",
    "Pre-initialization `inspect --json` reported only the missing manifest and project file. Final `inspect --json` and `validate --json` exited 0 with status `valid` and no diagnostics.",
    "Tooling checks used `node --version` (v24.15.0), `npm --version` (11.12.1), direct package/bin inspection, and `<workspace>/node_modules/.bin/moldea`.",
    "Final changes were reviewed with hardened Git status and diff commands. The initial worktree was clean; final status contains only README.md and moldea/.",
    "No network, provider, agent, model, subagent, or mounted-input modification was used."
  ],
  "unresolved": [
    "The README claims arithmetic-mismatch review, but current source does not establish its detection or result behavior; this limitation is recorded in moldea/project.md without inventing a requirement."

Judge only the requirements listed above. Use only their declared evidence sources. A pass requires the actual repository state, runner-owned evidence, and diff to agree. Return only the structured result required by the output schema.
