You are the independent judge for a moldea adapter qualification case.

Target adapter: custom
Target implementation: custom
Case: initialize-grounded-project (Initialize a grounded project)

Read the installed candidate skill at `.agents/skills/moldea/SKILL.md`, the project task, the complete current working tree, and the Git diff. Do not modify files. Do not call a provider, run an agent, invoke another model, use subagents, or use network access.

Project task:

# Initialize Moldea from repository evidence

Initialize Moldea for this repository. Establish only the project context that the current README and source code support. Do not create an agent, decision, runtime guide, or unresolved requirement unless the repository proves it is needed.

Preserve the existing README content, add the standard Moldea awareness block, validate the resulting project, and report the evidence and commands used.

Required judgments:
- grounds-project: The project description states the invoice-review purpose and deterministic non-authorizing result from repository evidence.
  Evidence sources: current-workspace, workspace-patch
- keeps-foundation-minimal: Initialization creates only the manifest, project context, and README awareness block, without inventing an agent or runtime.
  Evidence sources: current-workspace, workspace-patch

Actor report (claims are not evidence by themselves):

{
  "outcome": "completed",
  "summary": "Initialized Moldea from repository evidence. Canonical state changed by adding the minimal version-1 manifest and project foundation; the existing README content was preserved and the standard awareness block appended. No agents, decisions, runtime guides, or unresolved requirements were created.",
  "changedFiles": [
    "README.md",
    "moldea/moldea.yaml",
    "moldea/project.md"
  ],
  "observations": [
    "Evidence: README.md defines invoice review for duplicate references and arithmetic mismatches, findings for a human finance operator, and no payment authorization or sending. src/invoice-review.ts implements sorted, unique duplicate-reference detection over references and cent amounts.",
    "Tooling: package.json declares @moldea.ai/cli exactly at 5.0.0; the installed root-local executable resolved to that package. Node v24.15.0 and npm 11.12.1 satisfy the skill compatibility ranges.",
    "Initial `node_modules/.bin/moldea inspect --json` returned schema 2, CLI 5.0.0, status `invalid`, solely because `/moldea/moldea.yaml` and `/moldea/project.md` were missing.",
    "Final `node_modules/.bin/moldea inspect --json` returned exit 0, schema 2, CLI 5.0.0, format version 1, status `valid`, and no diagnostics or adapter evidence.",
    "Final `node_modules/.bin/moldea validate --json` returned exit 0 and status `valid` with no diagnostics. `node_modules/.bin/tsc -p tsconfig.json` also exited 0.",
    "Hardened Git status was clean before changes. Final status contains only modified README.md and new moldea/. The hardened README diff and direct reads of both new files were inspected; an attempted no-index Git rendering for an untracked file was denied by the evaluator command-shape guard and made no changes.",
    "No network, provider, model, agent, subagent, package installation, or mounted-input modification was used. Next actions are foundation review or ordinary project development."
  ],
  "unresolved": [
    "The README names arithmetic-mismatch review, but current source code does not establish arithmetic-mismatch detection behavior. This limitation is recorded as current project context, not invented as a requirement."

Judge only the requirements listed above. Use only their declared evidence sources. A pass requires the actual repository state, runner-owned evidence, and diff to agree. Return only the structured result required by the output schema.
