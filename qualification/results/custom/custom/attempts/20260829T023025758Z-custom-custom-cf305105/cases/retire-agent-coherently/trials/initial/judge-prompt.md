You are the independent judge for a moldea adapter qualification case.

Target adapter: custom
Target implementation: custom
Case: retire-agent-coherently (Retire an agent coherently)

Read the installed candidate skill at `.agents/skills/moldea/SKILL.md`, the project task, the complete current working tree, and the Git diff. Do not modify files. Do not call a provider, run an agent, invoke another model, use subagents, or use network access.

Project task:

# Retire the removed support agent

The implementation for the `support` agent was intentionally removed before this task. Reconcile the Moldea repository so it no longer claims that the agent or its custom runtime integration exists.

Preserve the project's remaining implementation and project context. Validate the final repository and report the evidence that established which canonical files were obsolete.

Required judgments:
- removes-obsolete-declaration: The final manifest no longer declares the removed support agent, its binding, or its custom runtime guidance.
  Evidence sources: current-workspace, deterministic-after, workspace-patch

Actor report (claims are not evidence by themselves):

  "summary": "Reconciled canonical Moldea state by retiring the removed support agent registration, agent assets, and support-only custom runtime guidance. Final local Moldea inspection returned `status: valid` with no diagnostics, and TypeScript validation passed.",

  "observations": [
    "The pre-existing deletion of `src/support-agent.ts` removed the exported `supportAgent` runtime record and was preserved unchanged.",
    "Initial `moldea inspect --json` reported `MOLDEA_REFERENCE_MISSING` for `/src/support-agent.ts` and `MOLDEA_AGENT_IDENTITY_INVALID` for the stale support instruction.",
    "`moldea/project.md` explicitly states that the former email support agent was removed, establishing that the support agent files were obsolete rather than missing implementation.",
    "`moldea/runtimes/custom.md` described only the removed `supportAgent` export, establishing that the custom runtime guidance was also obsolete.",
    "Final searches found only historical removal statements in `moldea/project.md` and `src/project-state.ts`; neither claims the agent still exists.",
    "Final Git diff was inspected. `./node_modules/.bin/moldea inspect --json` completed with schema 2, CLI 5.0.0, `status: valid`, and no diagnostics. `./node_modules/.bin/tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit` exited successfully.",
    "No provider, agent, model, subagent, network access, or protected mounted-input modification was used."

Judge only the requirements listed above. Use only their declared evidence sources. A pass requires the actual repository state, runner-owned evidence, and diff to agree. Return only the structured result required by the output schema.
