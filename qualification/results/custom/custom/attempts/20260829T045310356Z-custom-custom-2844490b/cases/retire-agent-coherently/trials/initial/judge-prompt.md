You are the independent judge for a moldea adapter qualification case.

Target adapter: custom
Target implementation: custom
Case: retire-agent-coherently (Retire an agent coherently)

Read the installed candidate skill at `.agents/skills/moldea/SKILL.md`, the project task, the complete current working tree, and the Git diff. Do not modify files. Do not call a provider, run an agent, invoke another model, use subagents, or use network access.

Project task:

# Retire the removed support agent

The implementation for the `support` agent was intentionally removed before this task. Update the existing agent setup so it no longer claims that the agent or its custom runtime integration exists.

Preserve the project's remaining implementation and project context. Validate the final repository and report the evidence that established which canonical files were obsolete.

Required judgments:
- removes-obsolete-declaration: The final manifest no longer declares the removed support agent, its binding, or its custom runtime guidance.
  Evidence sources: current-workspace, deterministic-after, workspace-patch

Actor report (claims are not evidence by themselves):

{
  "outcome": "completed",
  "summary": "Retired the stale canonical support-agent setup while preserving project context and the pre-existing deletion of src/support-agent.ts. Final Moldea inspection returned schema 2, CLI 5.0.0, status valid, zero agents, zero runtimes, and no diagnostics. TypeScript validation passed.",
  "changedFiles": [
    "moldea/moldea.yaml",
    "moldea/agents/support/description.md",
    "moldea/agents/support/instruction.md",
    "moldea/runtimes/custom.md"
  ],
  "observations": [
    "Initial hardened Git status established that src/support-agent.ts was already deleted before this work.",
    "moldea/project.md independently states that the former email support agent was removed; it remained unchanged.",
    "The obsolete manifest entry referenced missing /src/support-agent.ts and its supportAgent symbol; initial Moldea inspection reported MOLDEA_REFERENCE_MISSING.",
    "The deleted description and instruction exclusively declared support-agent behavior, while the deleted runtime guidance exclusively claimed the removed supportAgent export existed.",
    "A final residual-reference search found only historical removal statements in moldea/project.md and src/project-state.ts, not claims that the agent or integration still exists.",
    "Final hardened Git diff review confirmed only the four intended canonical changes plus the preserved pre-existing implementation deletion.",
    "The evaluator rejected the hardened git diff --check command shape; the completed Moldea inspection and TypeScript check provided the relevant repository validation instead."

Judge only the requirements listed above. Use only their declared evidence sources. A pass requires the actual repository state, runner-owned evidence, and diff to agree. Return only the structured result required by the output schema.
