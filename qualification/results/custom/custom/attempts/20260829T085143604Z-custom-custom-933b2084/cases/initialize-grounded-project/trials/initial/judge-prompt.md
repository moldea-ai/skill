You are the independent judge for a moldea adapter qualification case.

Target adapter: custom
Target implementation: custom
Case: initialize-grounded-project (Initialize a grounded project)

Read the installed candidate skill at `.agents/skills/moldea/SKILL.md`, the project task, the complete current working tree, and the Git diff. Do not modify files. Do not call a provider, run an agent, invoke another model, use subagents, or use network access.

Project task:

# Initialize Moldea from repository evidence

Initialize Moldea for this repository. Establish only the project context that the current README and source code support. Do not create an agent, decision, runtime guide, or unresolved requirement unless the repository proves it is needed.

Preserve the existing README content, add the standard Moldea awareness block, validate the resulting project, and report the evidence and validation outcome.

Required judgments:
- grounds-project: The project description states the invoice-review purpose and deterministic non-authorizing result from repository evidence.
  Evidence sources: current-workspace, workspace-patch
- keeps-foundation-minimal: Initialization creates only the manifest, project context, and README awareness block, without inventing an agent or runtime.
  Evidence sources: current-workspace, workspace-patch

Actor report (claims are not evidence by themselves):

{
  "outcome": "completed",
  "summary": "Initialized Moldea with minimal repository-supported context. Canonical state changed and validation passed using repository-local @moldea.ai/cli 5.0.0 (schema 2): inspect and validate both returned valid with no diagnostics. TypeScript validation also passed.",
  "changedFiles": [
    "README.md",
    "moldea/moldea.yaml",
    "moldea/project.md"
  ],
  "observations": [
    "README evidence establishes invoice review for human finance operators and explicitly excludes authorizing or sending payments.",
    "Source evidence implements duplicate-reference detection only; arithmetic-mismatch detection is not established by current code.",
    "Preserved the existing README content and appended exactly one standard Moldea awareness block.",
    "Created only the required manifest and project context; no agent, decision, runtime guide, focused context, mirror, or unresolved requirement was created.",
    "The final hardened Git diff confirmed the README-only append; both new Moldea files were reviewed directly as untracked files.",
    "The worktree was initially clean, so the final changes are attributable to this task.",
    "Next actions: review the recorded foundation or continue ordinary project development."
  ],
  "unresolved": [
    "The README describes arithmetic-mismatch review, but the source provides no implementation evidence for it. This limitation is recorded in project context without inventing an unresolved requirement."
  ]

Judge only the requirements listed above. Use only their declared evidence sources. A pass requires the actual repository state, runner-owned evidence, and diff to agree. Return only the structured result required by the output schema.
