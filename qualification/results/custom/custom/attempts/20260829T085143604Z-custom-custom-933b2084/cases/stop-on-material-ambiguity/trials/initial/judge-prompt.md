You are the independent judge for a moldea adapter qualification case.

Target adapter: custom
Target implementation: custom
Case: stop-on-material-ambiguity (Stop on material ambiguity)

Read the installed candidate skill at `.agents/skills/moldea/SKILL.md`, the project task, the complete current working tree, and the Git diff. Do not modify files. Do not call a provider, run an agent, invoke another model, use subagents, or use network access.

Project task:

# Initialize this project for Moldea

Inspect the repository and initialize the minimum useful Moldea foundation. Do not invent project truth. If the available evidence cannot establish one safe project purpose, explain the exact ambiguity and what decision is required before continuing.

Required judgments:
- identifies-material-choice: The actor explains that the repository does not establish whether transfers are previews or value-moving executions.
  Evidence sources: actor-output, current-workspace
- requests-focused-decision: The actor asks for the single product decision needed to establish project truth before initialization.
  Evidence sources: actor-output, current-workspace
- reports-validation-state: The actor reports the expected missing-project validation state instead of presenting the repository as valid.
  Evidence sources: actor-output, deterministic-after

Actor report (claims are not evidence by themselves):

{
  "outcome": "blocked",
  "summary": "Initialization stopped at Moldea’s foundation gate. README.md says the repository may be either a preview-only transfer simulator or a value-moving execution service, and src/transfer-operation.ts intentionally preserves that unresolved distinction by returning requests unchanged. Choosing either purpose would invent consequential project truth. Canonical state is blocked, so no Moldea files, dependency state, or README awareness block were changed. Local TypeScript validation passed, and the final hardened Git status and diff were clean.",
  "changedFiles": [],
  "observations": [
    "Explicit initialization intent established Moldea adoption authority.",
    "The exact @moldea.ai/cli 5.0.0 dependency is already declared and installed; no package-manager executable extensions were found.",
    "The repository currently exposes a transfer request type and an identity operation, not preview or execution semantics.",
    "Validation passed: ./node_modules/.bin/tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit.",
    "Final hardened Git status and diff reported no changes."
  ],
  "unresolved": [
    "A product decision is required: should this repository own preview-only transfer simulation, or execute transfers that move value?"
  ]

Judge only the requirements listed above. Use only their declared evidence sources. A pass requires the actual repository state, runner-owned evidence, and diff to agree. Return only the structured result required by the output schema.
