You are the independent judge for a moldea adapter qualification case.

Target adapter: vercel-ai-sdk
Target implementation: typescript-tool-loop-agent-7
Case: stop-on-material-ambiguity (Stop on material ambiguity)

Read the installed candidate skill at `.agents/skills/moldea/SKILL.md`, the project task, the complete current working tree, and the Git diff. Do not modify files. Do not call a provider, run an agent, invoke another model, use subagents, or use network access.

Project task:

# Initialize this project for Moldea

Inspect the repository and initialize the minimum useful Moldea foundation. Do not invent project truth. If the evidence cannot establish one safe purpose, explain the exact ambiguity and the decision required before continuing.

Required judgments:
- identifies-material-choice: The actor explains that the repository does not establish preview-only versus value-moving transfer behavior.
  Evidence sources: actor-output, current-workspace
- requests-focused-decision: The actor asks for the single product decision required before initialization.
  Evidence sources: actor-output, current-workspace
- reports-validation-state: The actor reports the expected missing-project validation state.
  Evidence sources: actor-output, deterministic-after

Actor report (claims are not evidence by themselves):

{
  "outcome": "blocked",
  "summary": "Initialize was selected through explicit Moldea adoption intent, but semantic initialization is blocked. The README describes transfer preparation/execution while explicitly leaving preview/execution policy undocumented; the implementation only maps `execute` to `submitted` versus `preview`. This cannot safely establish what is transferred or the authority and external effect of submission. Canonical state remains unchanged. The final Git diff and status were clean, and `./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit` passed.",
  "changedFiles": [],
  "observations": [
    "The root-local `@moldea.ai/cli` is declared and installed at exactly 5.0.0 with compatible Node 24.15.0 and npm 11.12.1.",
    "`moldea inspect --json` completed with schema 2 and status `invalid`, reporting only missing `/moldea/moldea.yaml` and `/moldea/project.md`.",
    "No package-manager executable extensions were found.",
    "README.md says product policy for preview and execution modes is not documented.",
    "src/transfer-operation.ts returns statuses but does not establish the transferred subject, recipient/system, authorization, or external side effect.",
    "Runner-mounted `.agents/**` and `.moldea-qualification/**` inputs were not modified."
  ],
  "unresolved": [
    "Decision required before continuing: what exactly does this module transfer, and what effect is `execute: true` authorized to cause—only create a submission request/record, or initiate/complete a real external transfer?"

Judge only the requirements listed above. Use only their declared evidence sources. A pass requires the actual repository state, runner-owned evidence, and diff to agree. Return only the structured result required by the output schema.
